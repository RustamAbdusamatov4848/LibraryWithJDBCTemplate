# LibraryWithJDBCTemplate
This is my first full-fledged project using the Spring framework.
The essence of this project, based on the name, is to provide a simple functionality for an online library, where a conditional librarian has 2 databases (a list of people and a list of books). The librarian has the ability to:
1. Add/Edit and remove people from the database;
2. Add / Edit and delete books from the database;
3. Give out books to a certain person, or after the person returned the book back to the library, mark it in the database.

That's all for now.
